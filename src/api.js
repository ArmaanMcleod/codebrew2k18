In particular, apart from cash donations, we look for donations that will help our students and school such as stationery, furniture, clothing, and academic support. We receive a lot of support each year and donations have become consistent thanks to our many partners such as Holy Innocentâ€™s High School in Hougang, Singapore, who donate furniture for our school to us.\n\nWe also receive support from Singaporean school students who help pack donations such as furniture and health aid to be delivered back to our foundation. We are truly thankful and grateful to all those who help us each and every year, and for those who are looking to donate, please contact us!",
