They have escaped a horrible war, and have finally secured a degree of safety and security, but the road will be very tough for them.  They will be starting at zero in a new country.  In addition to the culture shock, they will face innumerable obstacles, including the need to learn an entirely new language.  As they attempt to get their footing, they will be provided with little more than the bare minimum needed to subsist. This holiday season, let's give them a little breathing room." ,

Under the FDA's rule, any vapor product that has come to market since that date (i.e., every product on the market today) must retroactively undergo a potentially multi-million dollar pre-market approval process if they wish to have a hope of staying on the market past August 2018.
